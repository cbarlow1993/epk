# DJ EPK Platform — Business, Marketing & Pricing Strategy

## Context

- **Product:** Multi-tenant DJ Electronic Press Kit SaaS
- **Stage:** Pre-launch, product built, zero users
- **Budget:** Zero marketing spend — organic only
- **Goal:** Grow user base first, prove product-market fit
- **Market:** Global, all DJ levels (emerging to established)

## 1. Growth Engine — The Built-In Viral Loop

The strongest growth asset is already built: every free EPK page carries a "Built with DJ EPK" footer. Every time a DJ shares their EPK link with a promoter, venue, agent, or posts it on social media, they advertise the product to exactly the right audience.

**The core strategy: maximise the number of EPK links being shared.**

### Principles

- **Signup to published EPK in under 10 minutes.** A DJ should be able to sign up, add their name, bio, socials, and one mix, and have a live shareable link. No friction, no onboarding walls.
- **Keep the free tier genuinely good.** All 8 core sections, templates, and theming stay free. A weak free tier kills the viral loop — every free user with a published EPK is a marketing channel.
- **Make the public page look impressive.** When a promoter clicks a DJ EPK link, their reaction should be "this looks professional — how do I get one?" The page itself is the best ad.
- **The footer link should point to a landing page** with a clear CTA: "Create your free DJ EPK in minutes."

## 2. Launch Strategy — Seeding the First 100 Users

With zero budget, go where DJs already hang out and offer genuine value. Target: 100 active users with published EPKs within the first few months.

### Phase 1: Direct outreach

- **Reddit** — r/DJs, r/Beatmatch, r/edmproduction. These communities reject self-promotion but welcome free tools. Post as "I built this, looking for feedback" — not as an ad. Help people set up their EPK in the comments.
- **Facebook Groups** — DJ groups are massive and active (DJ Tips & Tricks, genre-specific groups). Same approach: value-first, not salesy.
- **Discord servers** — DJ and producer Discords are full of emerging artists who need exactly this.

### Phase 2: SEO content that compounds

Write 3-5 blog posts targeting searches DJs actually make:

- "How to make a DJ press kit"
- "DJ EPK template"
- "What to include in a DJ press kit"
- "How to get booked as a DJ"
- "DJ press kit examples"

Each post ends with a CTA to create a free EPK. This costs nothing but time and compounds over months as posts start ranking.

### Phase 3: Leverage existing users

- After a DJ publishes their EPK, prompt them: "Share your EPK on socials and tag us."
- Feature the best EPKs on the DJ EPK social accounts ("EPK of the week").
- Every shared link reaches promoters, other DJs, and managers — all potential users.

## 3. Pricing Strategy

### Current structure

| | Free | Pro (£9/month) |
|---|---|---|
| Full EPK page | Yes | Yes |
| Custom subdomain (name.djepk.com) | Yes | Yes |
| All 8 sections | Yes | Yes |
| Templates | Yes | Yes |
| Custom domain | No | Yes |
| Remove "Built with DJ EPK" branding | No | Yes |
| Analytics dashboard | No | Yes |
| File storage | 5 GB | 100 GB |
| Advanced theme customisation | Basic | Full |
| Integrations (GA, Plausible, Mailchimp) | No | Yes |

### Why this works

The free tier is the growth engine. Don't strip it down to force upgrades — every free user with a live EPK feeds the viral loop. Free users pay in exposure.

### Pro upgrade triggers

The upgrade hooks should appeal to vanity and professionalism, not gate core functionality:

1. **Custom domain** — The strongest hook. A DJ serious enough to want `dj-name.com` is serious enough to pay. It signals professionalism.
2. **Remove branding** — Second strongest. When a DJ sends their EPK to a major promoter or agency, "Built with DJ EPK" in the footer feels amateur to them. They'll pay to remove it.
3. **Analytics** — Knowing who's viewing the EPK and where they come from is genuinely useful for working DJs tracking submission impact.

### Pricing adjustments to consider

- **Annual billing:** Offer £7/month billed annually (£84/year). Reduces churn and the discount nudges users toward longer commitment.
- **Early-access lifetime deal:** £99 one-time payment for lifetime Pro access. Generates upfront cash, creates loyal early adopters, and produces testimonials. Retire the offer once traction is established.

### Agency pricing

This is the long-term revenue play, but don't focus on it yet. Get individual DJs first — agencies will come when their artists are already on the platform. Revisit agency pricing once you have 500+ individual users.

## 4. Retention & Activation

The biggest risk is "set and forget" — a DJ builds their EPK once and never returns. That's acceptable for the viral loop (the page stays live), but it kills upgrade potential.

### Activation funnel

Track where users drop off across these milestones:

1. **Profile complete** — Name, photo, tagline. Takes 2 minutes.
2. **First section filled** — Bio or one mix added. The EPK starts looking real.
3. **Published** — They flip the toggle and have a live URL. This is the critical moment.
4. **First share** — They send the link to someone. Now they're invested.

If most people sign up but never publish, the editor is too complex or slow. If they publish but never share, the page doesn't look good enough to feel proud of.

### Re-engagement

- **Weekly "EPK views" email** — "Your EPK was viewed 14 times this week." Simple, free to build (PostHog data already exists), reminds users the product exists, and naturally nudges toward the analytics Pro feature ("Upgrade to see who's viewing and where they're coming from").
- **Seasonal prompts** — "Festival season is coming — is your EPK up to date?" DJs have natural cycles around booking seasons.
- **Template drops** — Release a new template, email all users. Gives them a reason to log back in and refresh their page.

Keep it simple. A single weekly stats email and occasional manual campaigns. No complex notification system or drip sequences yet.

## 5. Social Media & Content Strategy

Pick two channels and do them well. Don't spread thin.

### Instagram — primary channel

DJs live on Instagram. Content strategy:

- **EPK showcases** — Screenshot or screen-record the best user EPKs (with permission). "Check out @djname's press kit." This flatters the DJ (they'll repost), exposes the product, and creates content without starting from scratch.
- **Before/after** — "Sending a PDF vs sending a DJ EPK link." Quick visual comparisons hitting the pain point.
- **Tips content** — "5 things every promoter wants to see in your press kit." Positions DJ EPK as the authority on DJ marketing, not just a tool.
- **Dashboard reels** — 15-second screen recordings showing how fast you can build an EPK. Speed and simplicity sell.

Post 3-4 times per week. Sustainable for one person.

### TikTok — secondary channel

Same content repackaged as short-form video. DJ TikTok is large and the algorithm favours small accounts. The "I built an app that..." format performs well for developer-founders.

### Skip for now

- **Twitter/X** — DJ community is smaller there and the algorithm rewards high-frequency posting that isn't sustainable solo.
- **Paid ads** — At zero budget and pre-traction, ads waste money. Organic builds trust that ads can't buy. Revisit paid once there are 500+ users and the conversion funnel is understood.

## 6. Timeline & Milestones

### Month 1-2: Seed & Launch

- Polish the landing page: clear headline, 3 feature highlights, one CTA.
- Post on Reddit, Facebook groups, Discord servers.
- Set up Instagram account. Post EPK showcases (use test EPKs initially).
- Write the first SEO blog post targeting "DJ press kit template" or similar.
- Implement the weekly EPK views email.
- **Target: 50 signups, 25 published EPKs.**

### Month 3-4: Build the Loop

- Early users should be sharing EPK links organically. The footer is doing work.
- Launch "EPK of the week" on Instagram. Reach out to the best-looking user EPKs.
- Write 2-3 more SEO blog posts. They take time to rank but compound.
- First Pro conversions should appear — single digits is normal at this stage.
- **Target: 200 signups, 100 published EPKs.**

### Month 5-6: Optimise

- By now there's enough data to answer: Where do users come from? Where do they drop off? What triggers Pro upgrades?
- Double down on what's working. Kill what isn't.
- Consider launching the lifetime deal for cash injection and testimonials.
- Start TikTok if there's bandwidth.
- **Target: 500 signups, 5-10 Pro subscribers.**

## 7. Key Metrics

Track five numbers. Not twenty.

| Metric | Why it matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Signups | Top of funnel — are people finding the product? |
| **Published EPKs** | **North star metric — activation and viral loop health** |
| Public page views | Viral loop reach — are EPK links being clicked? |
| Free to Pro conversion rate | Revenue health — target 2-5% long term |
| Monthly active dashboard logins | Retention — are users coming back? |

**Published EPKs is the single most important number.** A published EPK means the DJ found enough value to go live, and every live EPK feeds the growth loop.

---

## Summary

The strategy is: build a genuinely good free product that markets itself through usage, seed the first users through community outreach and SEO, retain them with a simple weekly stats email, and convert the serious ones to Pro through custom domains and branding removal. No paid spend, no complex funnels, no premature optimisation. Get to 500 published EPKs, then reassess.
